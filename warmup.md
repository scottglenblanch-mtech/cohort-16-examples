Todayâ€™s Warmup,
Create a website that shows a stop light intersection.
There is a stoplight for going top/bottom direction. There is a stoplight going left/right. Make sure that one of the stoplight is red when the other stoplight is green or yellow.
Have the stoplight sequence change every 2 seconds. Stoplight 1 will go red, then green, then yellow, then red. Stoplight 2 will then go green, yellow, red. Then repeat.
